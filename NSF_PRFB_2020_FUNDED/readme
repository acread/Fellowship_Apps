These are some of the materials from my NSF_ predoctoral fellowship application -- these include my biosketch, project description, as well as the comments I received back from reviewers (I believe these will be particularly useful for others... try to strengthen the areas I was weak in)

If you have questions about the application process please reach out!  I'm happy to do what I can to help :)
